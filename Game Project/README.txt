This game is a 2D game inspired by the Portal Flash Game (http://portal.wecreatestuff.com/).
The four features we implemented are animation, collectables, scrolling level, and a timer. 

Controls:
W- jump / up in menus
A- left
S- down in menus
D- left
B- moves back to title menu
K- kills game(not title)
Mouse cursor- aims where the portal will be shot
Q- fires a blue portal
E- fires an orange portal

Goal and Notes:
-Going through an orange portal makes the character come out of the blue portal and vice versa
-Go from one end of the level to the other
-Make it to the red square at the end
-All green squares can have a portal on them
-All white squares cannot have a portal on them
-There are ten yellow squares (coins) throughout the level to collect
